# Solution for Module 6 Challenge

This site has been created as a source for weather information, dislplaying both the current weather, as well as a 5 day forcast for a desired location.  The entered locations are stored in local history, with the option to clear out what has been saved as well.  The weather and forcast both display temperature, windspeed, humidity, as well as an icon representing the visibility conditions.
